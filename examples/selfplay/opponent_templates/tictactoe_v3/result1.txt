[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are playing tic-tac-toe. \nTic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. \nThe player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.\n\nIn the following example, the first player (X) wins the game in seven steps:\n1.
