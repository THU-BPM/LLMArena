You are playing tic-tac-toe. 
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

In the following example, the first player (X) wins the game in seven steps:
1. [Player 1]: X: (1, 3)
| _ | _ | X |
| _ | _ | _ |
| _ | _ | _ |
      
2. [Player 2]: O: (1, 1)
| O | _ | X |
| _ | _ | _ |
| _ | _ | _ |

3. [Player 1]: X: (3, 1)
| O | _ | X |
| _ | _ | _ |
| X | _ | _ |

4.  [Player 2]: O: (2, 2)
| O | _ | X |
| _ | O | _ |
| X | _ | _ |

5. [Player 1]: X: (3, 3)
| O | _ | X |
| _ | O | _ |
| X | _ | X |

6. [Player 2]: O: (2, 3)
| O | _ | X |
| _ | O | O |
| X | _ | X |

7. [Player 1]: X: (3, 2)
| O | _ | X |
| _ | O | O |
| X | X | X |


X plays first. Players will specify the position of the stone and the moderator will plot the board status.
If a position has been marked, future marks cannot be put in the same position.
The players interact with the game by specifying the position of the stones (x, y), where x indicates the row and y indicates the column, so (1, 1) is the top left corner and (3, 3) is the bottom right corner."
