    "prompt_rule": "You are playing tic-tac-toe. \nTic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. \nVictory is achieved by the player who first aligns three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player using X initiates the game. X plays first. Players will specify the position of the stone and the moderator will plot the board status.\nOnce a grid slot is occupied, it cannot be selected again for a new move. Players communicate their moves by indicating the coordinates (x, y), where x represents the row and y the column; thus, the coordinate (1, 1) corresponds to the upper-left corner, while (3, 3) refers to the lower-right corner.",
