Each marker will fall to the lowest available space within the selected column. \nThe player who succeeds in placing four of their makers in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.\nX plays first. Players interact with the game by specifying the column number where they want to drop their marker. If a column is already full, players cannot drop a marker into that column.\nThe columns are numbered from 1 to 7, from left to right. Players cannot place a token outside this range.",
