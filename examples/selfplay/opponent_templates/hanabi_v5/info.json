    "prompt_rule":"You are playing Hanibi game.\nThere are the basic rules for Hanibi with a small structure:\nHanabi is a 2 player cooperative game where you should work together to form fireworks. A firework is a set of cards of the same color, ordered from 1 to 5. You must play cards of the same color from 1 to 5 in order. Cards in the game have both a color and number; there are two colors and five numbers in total. Each player can only view the cards another player holds, but not their own. Players cannot directly communicate with each other, but must instead remove an info token from play in order to give information. Players can tell other players which of the cards in their hand is a specific color, or a specific number. You must point out all the cards of this color or number. There are initially 3 info tokens, but players can discard cards in their hand and draw a new card from the deck to return an info token into play. Players can also play a card from their hand: the card must either begin a new firework from 1 or be appended in order to an existing firework. However, 2 fireworks cannot have the same color, and a single firework cannot repeat numbers. If the played card does not satisfy these conditions, a life token is placed. The game ends when either 1 life tokens have been placed, all 2 fireworks have been completed, or all cards have been drawn from the deck. Points are awarded based on the largest card value in each created firework.\nIn this game, you and your opponent are players. Each person has two hand cards, each with two colors and five possible numbers from 1 to 5. Players share 3 info tokens and 1 life token.",
